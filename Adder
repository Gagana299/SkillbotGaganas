FAST LIB:- It is a set of libraries which provides the cell models and components for high speed operations.
Library (gpdk045wc):- specifies the library file and which is a generic physical design kit used with 45nm TSMC version.
Which is a set of semiconductor process design kit which provided by cadence design system.
These kits include various libraries and design systems.
It gives the information about each cell function which is of power consumption, area and timing.
unit attributes:- In this file we are reffering about full adder circuits.Below are some of the points which refer to that
It will operate in the 1v,1ma and the time duration of 1ns.
Default power supply voltage used is of 1.32v.
Leakage power unwantes subthreshold current in the transistor channel when the transistor is turned off.
Default its operating condition is of fast.
Designing the adder circuit. That also includes the 7X7 matrix.
Area required is of 0.0, temmperature is 0.
Adder considered is "0" cell leakage power which is of 1.09891
Pins are of A,B,CI,CO.
A & B are the input pins
CI & CO are of sum and carry.
The function for CO = (((AB)+(B CI)+(CI A))) this performs the carry function which is related to the pin A.
Pin S is used for Sum function ((A^B)^CI).
It performs separate operation for each function using basic gates (CLKAND, CLKXOR, CLKOR, CLKBUF, CLKINV, CLKMX).
It even combines the design of Flipflop.
Here we can also get to know about the cell fall time, rise time, power consumption and direction.
